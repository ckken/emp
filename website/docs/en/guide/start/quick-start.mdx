# Quick Start

## Environment Setup

Before getting started, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and ensure Node.js version >= 20. **We recommend using Node.js 20 LTS version**.

You can check your current Node.js version using the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

If you haven't installed Node.js in your current environment, or if your installed version is too old, you can install the required version using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm).

Here's an example of installing Node.js 20 LTS version using nvm:

```bash
# Install Node.js 20 LTS version
nvm install 20 --lts

# Set the newly installed Node.js 20 as the default version
nvm alias default 20

# Switch to the newly installed Node.js 20
nvm use 20
```

## Creating an EMP Project

You can use `create-emp` to create an EMP project by running the following command:

<PackageManagerTabs command="create emp@latest" />


Then follow the prompts. You can choose from the following templates provided by `create-emp`:

| Template | Description                    | Optional Features |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| react    | [React 18](https://react.dev/) | TypeScript      |
| vue3     | [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)    | TypeScript      |
| vue2     | [Vue 2](https://v2.vuejs.org/) | TypeScript      |


## Command Line Tools

`EMP` CLI includes a lightweight command-line tool with commands like dev, build, and more.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    // Start the development server
    "dev": "emp dev",
    // Build for production
    "build": "emp build",
    // Preview the production version locally
    "start": "emp serve",
    // Bundle size analysis
    "stat": "emp build --analyze"
  }
}
```

Please refer to [CLI Tools] to learn about all available commands and options.

## Entry Module

`EMP` CLI uses `src/index.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)` as the default entry module. You can modify the entry module using the [entry] configuration option.
